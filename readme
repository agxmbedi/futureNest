Calculator Logic:

Title: How the Calculator Works
Content:
Uses the formula FV=PV×(1+R)^n to estimate future value of savings.
FV (Future Value): The amount of money expected to be available at retirement.
PV (Present Value): Current savings.
R (Rate of Return): Average investment return.
n (Number of Years): Years until retirement.
Incorporates inflation and income needs to project the retirement fund's sufficiency.

What is Purchasing Power?
Purchasing power refers to the amount of goods or services that one unit of currency can buy. It reflects the real value of money over time.
Importance: the same amount of money will buy fewer goods and services in the future.

Inflation's Impact on Purchasing Power
Inflation: The general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.
Example: If the inflation rate is 3% per year, something that costs $100 today will cost $103 next year.
Relevance to Retirement: Inflation significantly impacts retirement savings, as it reduces the future value of saved money.


Integrating Purchasing Power into WealthWard Calculator
Inputs Related to Inflation:

Inflation Rate: Users input an expected annual inflation rate.
Average Investment Return: Users provide an expected return on their investments, which should ideally outpace inflation.



Future Value of Current Savings
Formula:
FV=PV×(1+r)^n
PV (Present Value): Current savings amount.
r (Rate of Return): Expected annual investment return.
n (Number of Years): Years until retirement.


Future Contributions
Formula:
FV=PMT×((1+r)^r -1)/r
PMT (Payment): Annual savings contribution.
r (Rate of Return): Expected annual investment return.
n (Number of Years): Years until retirement.

Total Retirement Savings
Total Savings=FV of Current Savings+FV of Future Contributions

​

Future Income Needs
Steps:

Calculate required income at retirement based on current income and desired replacement rate.
Adjust for inflation over the retirement period.
Formula for Required Income:
Required Income=Current Income×Replacement Rate



Formula for Adjusting for Inflation:

Adjusted Income=Required Income×(1+Inflation Rate)^n


Determine Replacement Rate:
Replacement Rate=Desired Income as a Percentage of Current Income



Purpose:
